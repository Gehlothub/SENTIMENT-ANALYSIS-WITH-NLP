# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-WITH-NLP#  Sentiment Analysis with NLP

This project demonstrates how to perform **Sentiment Analysis** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques in Python. The notebook walks through key steps such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation using a machine learning classifier.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `re` (Regular Expressions)
- `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)
- `sklearn` (Scikit-learn)

##  Key Features

- Importing and cleaning textual data
- Tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal using `nltk`
- Transforming text data into numerical format using **Bag-of-Words** (`CountVectorizer`)
- Building a classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes or other ML models)
- Evaluating the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix

##  Output

- Cleaned and preprocessed text
- A trained sentiment classifier
- Accuracy metrics and confusion matrix

##  Use Case

This project can be used for:
- Classifying customer reviews as positive or negative
- Building the base of a chatbotâ€™s emotional understanding
- Social media analysis and brand monitoring
